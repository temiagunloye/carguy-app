## 📄 QUICK LICENSE DOCUMENTATION

**What You Need from Each Model:**

When you downloaded each model from Sketchfab, you visited a specific model page.

### Where to Find License Info on Sketchfab:

On each model's page, scroll down and look for:
- **Creator name** (usually at the top under the model viewer)
- **License badge** (shows CC-BY or similar)
- **The URL** of that page (copy from browser address bar)

## 🚀 EASIEST METHOD: Give Me the URLs

**Just send me the 3 Sketchfab URLs you downloaded from, and I'll extract:**
- Creator name
- Exact license type
- Attribution text needed

**Example URL format:**
```
https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/honda-civic-2022-abc123xyz
```
